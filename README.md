# 2x2_RubixCube
## A moveable 2x2 Rubix Cube


### Languages Used:

c


### To Use:

* `git clone https://github.com/gamblinflanagan/2x2_RubixCube/`
* `run the file cube.c in any c/c++ IDE`

### To Run In Linux/Unix Command Line:

* Open a terminal Shell
* run `gcc cube.c`
* to compile with ansi run `gcc -ansi -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror cube.c`
* run `./a.out` followed by a space

### IMPORTANT The program takes a SINGLE commandline argument of a combination of any of the following letters after `./a.out` 
### IMPORTANT Make sure there is a space between `a.out` and the first argument
### Adding the following letters will rotate the specific side 1/4 rotation counter clockwise relative to the side

* F(Front)
* B(Back)
* U(Top)
* D(Bottom)
* L(Left)
* R(Right)

### Adding a `+` sign next to any letter makes the rotation counterclockwise
### Adding a `2` next to any letter adds another 1/4 rotation making it a total of 1/2 rotation (its the equivalent of entering a letter twice)

### The following letters will rotate the cube 1/4 clockwise on a specific axis

* X(x-axis)
* Y(y-axis)
* Z(z-axis)

### Adding a `+` sign next to any letter makes the rotation counterclockwise
### Adding a `2` next to any letter adds another 1/4 rotation making it a total of 1/2 rotation (its the equivalent of entering a letter twice)
